# QR-Code-Generator-and-Email-Sender

In this repo, I have built one program using Python which can generate QR code from a set of data (csv file) and then for each row
it can generate QR code 
While generating QR code it can send that QR code to that email address given in each row

#Why This Project?
I, as a technical head of one student organization, have to manage events technically. Previously we gave each participants only
the ticket , paper ticket. Also we had to send confirmation email to everyone by copying and pasting their emails everytime.
It takes so much time and then I have decided to build this program so that we can generate a paperless ticket for each event and then 
we can send it to them.
